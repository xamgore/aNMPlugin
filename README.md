The latest stable build was compiled using RAD Studio 7.
Delphi project can be found [here](https://github.com/xamgore/aNMPlugin/tree/master/delphi). 
Recently I have made an attempt to rewrite the plugin using AIMP API v3.0, but delphi is an awful language,
API is hard to understand and I have moved to Linux. So, if you want to make something with it, you are welcome!

Some points you may find interesting:

* The next version of plugin would be named `aNMScrobbler`, if I realeased it.
* There is a security problem now: logins and passwords are stored in a raw format.
* Plugin is three years old, I have started writing it in 2013 (school time :smile:).
